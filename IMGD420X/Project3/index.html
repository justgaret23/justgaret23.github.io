                <h3>Assignment 3: Reaction Diffusion</h3>
                <a href="https://justgaret23.github.io/IMGD420X/Project3/diffusion.html">Check out the simulation here!</a><br>
                <h4>Aesthetic and Technical Intent</h4>
                    <p>
                        I decided to make a simulation that was very close to the original Karl Sims algorithm in terms of implementation. 
                        I conveyed chemicals using the RGB colors in gl_fragColor, with chemicalA being represented by red, and chemicalB being represented by blue. 
                        My four basic controls involved modifying the feed rate and kill rate alongside the diffusion of both chemicals A and B. 
                        I took great care to put effective limits on them, as an imbalance too great could lead to a black box consuming the simulation or to chemical B dying out prematurely. 
                        Though pushing my simulation to its limits will lead to an untimely death, the balance is solid enough to the point where breaking it is only possible through cranking the simulation up to an extreme for a time period in which you can react to your mistake. 
                        My addition to the basic formula consisted of varying the pattern of the reaction diffusion along the x and y-axis. 
                        Though the difference in patterns takes some time to appear, the differences between patterns on different parts of the screen become clear over time. 
                        I didnâ€™t have many aesthetic considerations when making my simulation aside from keeping it as simple as possible given my time constraints and and need to get a basic version up and running as opposed to trying to do something fancy.

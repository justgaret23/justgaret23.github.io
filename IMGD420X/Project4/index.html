                <h4>Preset Descriptions</h4>
                    <p>
                        My first control was sensorMultiplier. 
                        This one was pointed out to us as we started, and modifying it immediately made fun and interesting events happen onscreen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My second control was rotateMultiplier. 
                        This causes the agents to converge towards the center in an interesting way, allowing for more interesting visual movement possibilities in the simulation.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My third control was directionDistance. 
                        This gave the simulated lines a flashy, vibrating effect, increasing the volatility of the simulation. This allowed for more interesting behavior, as I could completely stabilize or destabilize the simulation at a whim and cause split-second interesting reactions to occur.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My fourth control was offsetMultiplier. 
                        This had a similar effect to rotateMultiplier (converging agents towards the center) but when combining it with rotateMultiplier, I can freeze certain parts of the simulation which can allow for some interesting interactions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My first preset, and my personal favorite, was burst.
                        This makes the simulation periodically pulse, making its ends emit agents in a variety of directions. 
                        It creates a variety of interesting effects, and can vastly differ in execution depending on how the agents are laid across the screen. 
                        It was very fun to play around with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My second preset was hardRotate. 
                        This freezes some parts of the simulation in place. 
                        It also synergizes with burst very well, making a firework-like display across the screen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My third preset was converge. 
                        This forces all agents to the center far more rapidly than the rotateMultiplier and offsetMultiplier, often resulting in one big blob near the center of the screen. 
                        It also synergizes well with burst, almost making a nebula-type effect that is very interesting to watch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My final preset was pos.
                        This changes up the polar coordinates of the simulation, splitting up the agents so that a sharp diagonal line separates two galaxies of agents. 
                        As with all my other presets, it synergizes very well with burst, creating some interesting explosions.

                <h4>Aesthetic and Technical Intent</h4>
                    <p>
                        My aesthetic intent for this assignment was to play around with the bubble simulator effect in the book of shaders and extend it so a user could modify it in interesting ways. 
                        I wanted to create something with a bubbly, shimmery look that was also somewhat transparent so it could have good synergy with the video background.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was interested in exploring how the bubbles worked on a technical level, since I thought they looked cool and wanted to learn about how they were generated on a more complex level. 
                        The bubbles were mostly generated using an snoise function provided in the example I pulled from the the book of shaders that I modified in a few ways. 
                        The snoise function used several glsl parameters, primarily permutation and modulo289 functions. 
                        Many vec3s were multiplied against each other to and were eventually combined in a dot function call, giving us the dots we have now. 
                        Modifying how these parameters using multiplicative floats resulted in many interesting effects popping up with the bubbles, making it very fun to play around with technically.

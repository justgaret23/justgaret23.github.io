                <h4>Aesthetic and Technical Intent</h4>
                    <p>
                        My aesthetic intent for this project was to manipulate red lines in a variety of ways to make a piece both interesting and mildly intense.
                        One of my loose inspirations was the final fight against Giygas in Earthbound. In this fight, Giygas is in an ethereal state and is represented
                        by an eerie red pattern of lines repeated across the screen an infinite amount of times. My piece is far less eerie,
                        but it was on my mind while creating my animations and I tried to ramp up the intensity over time in a loosely similar fashion to how Giygas became more
                        and more distorted as that fight went on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My technical goals for this project were to explore a lot of The Force's functions and experiment with how they transformed the simple sin wave line animation.
                        The core of my project revolved around getting the sine, tangent, and cosine of a common function and overlaying them at varying points in the animation.
                        I then added on other functions to make those animations more interesting such as using smoothstep to make the cosine's cone-like pattern transition smoothly
                        and distorting the sine using noise. I also inserted a noise-converted vector consisting of the normalalized uv's to further vary the patterns at several points
                        and add further smoothness using the lastFrame method covered in lecture.
                    </p>
                <h4>Feedback (Credit to Geoffrey Garsson for providing feedback)</h4>
                    <p>
                        Originally, I was planning on overlaying several colors on top of each other to create a dazzling effect of all three RGB colors. However, upon showing it off 
                        midway through production to Geoff, he provided interesting feedback in that I should keep to one color and keep the animation constrained enough to the point 
                        where it's easy on the eyes. I took this feedback into account, removing fast and twitchy animations from my display while trying to keep all of them smooth. 
                        When I showed it to him again upon completion, he considered it to be an improvement, as I expected. I initially did not expect keeping colors to a minimum to
                        be such a major part of my final animation, but I am happy to have received that feedback after finishing the project.
                    </p>
